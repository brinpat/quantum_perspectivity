# Quantum Perspectivity

Wave repels dark matter causing radial space around the wave to be less dense and so creates spacetime tunnel with higher refractive index trapping waves within a spacetime "gravitational" tunnel. 
 
Higher energy waves may collide with dark matter edge more causing bends in spacetime manifold tunnel eventually creating a looped spacetime manifold.
 
This will cause all the waves to loop in a torus shape overtime turning the torus into a sphere as the tunnel widens and forms a spherical wave particle with a gravitational manifold around it.
